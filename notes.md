## Concept
take audio from a podcast, read into the transcript and visualize shapes based upon spikes in audio waveforms.

## To do list
[ ] Download a podcast
[ ] Tinker with the sound microphone api from google
[ ] make it work on a internal audio source instead of the mic
[ ] test the api with the podcast
[ ] Implement the grid system for the visualisation
[ ] Profit!
